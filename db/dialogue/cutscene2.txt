You, A, B, C: ...??? >> images/backgrounds/scene2-1.png
Ms. Kuberska: You see, Mr. Weinstein, Ms. Basias, Mr. Detchkov, and I//used to preside over this land... >> images/backgrounds/scene2-1.png
Ms. Kuberska: But everything changed when the Boiled Potato attacked. >> images/backgrounds/scene2-1.png
Ms. Kuberska: Now, he steals munchkins and sends out tyrannical math//problems to terrorize students throughout the land. >> images/backgrounds/scene2-1.png
Ms. Kuberska: We need YOUR help to restore order to HABC with the//power of math! >> images/backgrounds/scene2-1.png
Ms. Kuberska: Right now, you only have a PENCIL and the abilities//to SOLVE FOR X (attack) and SIMPLIFY EXPRESSIONS (defend). >> images/backgrounds/scene2-1.png
Ms. Kuberska: You will have to learn calculus from scratch - starting\//with basic algebra, here in ALGEBRA ALLEY! >> images/backgrounds/scene2-1.png
Ms. Kuberska: But don't worry, we will do our best to prepare you! >> images/backgrounds/scene2-1.png
Ms. Kuberska: As you improve, speak to Mr. Detchkov in TRIG TOWN//to acquire better calculators and tools. >> images/backgrounds/scene2-1.png

You, A, B, C: ...Wow. >> images/backgrounds/scene2-0.png
Friend A: So basically we're taking the AP in some//alternate world. >> images/backgrounds/scene2-0.png
You: ...By killing math problems. >> images/backgrounds/scene2-0.png
Friend C: This is gonna be lit. >> images/backgrounds/scene2-0.png
